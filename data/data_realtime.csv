1,2025-11-23 12:43:44,SouthwestAirlines,For real.,negative
2,2025-11-23 12:43:22,SouthwestAirlines,Wow. You’re spineless.,negative
3,2025-11-23 12:43:03,SouthwestAirlines,"Why nudge? Simply say “get all of your body parts into YOUR space”. If he doesn’t move, call FA immediately.",negative
4,2025-11-23 12:41:53,SouthwestAirlines,They’re like this because people like you allow it. There’d be no “moving a little”. I’d look this guy in the face and say “You have one chance to put your lake into your own space.  Then I will call the flight attendant.” Then just stare. Wait about 10 seconds. Call FA if this misogynist doesn’t comply. Done.,negative
5,2025-11-23 12:29:51,SouthwestAirlines,Just bring  another smaller item to go under the seat.,neutral
6,2025-11-23 12:43:32,Delta,"Wait, people raw dog for recognition and bragging rights? I just do it to zone out and think about fantasy stuff. Like if I was a medieval king, and my army fought another army and won -- what do I do with all the enemies swords and gear? Do I smelt it down, do I reuse it?  \---  sometimes if I'm being cheeky I just stare at someone else's movie screen and wonder what's going on without audio. It's how I realized that Avatar 2 must be a really, really long movie.",negative
7,2025-11-23 12:42:36,Delta,interesting take. i don’t get free upgrades with my card and don’t have status,neutral
8,2025-11-23 12:41:25,Delta,"I’ve microdosed on flights and its always been lovely, but Im a longtime stoner / shroomer (and almost always smoke a joint right before flights, and usually eat a couple gummies too if it’s international)",positive
9,2025-11-23 12:41:11,Delta,I’ve done this on a coach transfer from a flight before. Ended up being a really long transfer cos of traffic so my phone was dying and I had to switch it off. Didn’t have a book or anything with me and I can’t sleep well in cars/coaches. Just zoned out for about 4 hours until we arrived,negative
10,2025-11-23 12:40:12,Delta,"I agree, or I don’t understand the current tripping balls.  My ass would not be able to sit there like that tripping balls",negative
11,2025-11-23 12:32:35,AlaskaAirlines,Thank you! Yes I was able to select my seat ( and my companion’s) on JAL website. It showed as “requested” the whole time but when we checked in online we got those exact seats. Didn’t choose meals but saw that as an option. Hope this helps and happy planning your trip!,positive
12,2025-11-23 12:27:58,AlaskaAirlines,"Flew on a long 5 hour flight, had the same experience now dealing with serious back issues from that flight. I won't fly Alaska ever again.",negative
13,2025-11-23 12:06:23,AlaskaAirlines,"I had a flight diverted to Paine Field because of low ceilings at SeaTac. Flight was eventually cancelled. We took a Lyft even before the cancellation and barely made our connection. I sent the receipt along with a brief summary and my confirmation code to the customer care email. They reimbursed except tip. It took about a month, but no questions asked.",negative
14,2025-11-23 11:56:56,AlaskaAirlines,I dont think any of the seats on this flight recline?? Just had a red eye and no sleep. F alaska if they’re going cheap on us,negative
15,2025-11-23 11:51:42,AlaskaAirlines,Thank you.,positive
16,2025-11-23 12:43:28,UnitedAirlines,"You can too just ask for one from the FA, they'll go grab it.",neutral
17,2025-11-23 12:42:20,UnitedAirlines,"My 6 ft husband is learning to stand up, FC aisle seat, so that traffic from the back is impeded.  He hates smelling people as they walk by or those that bump him. I'm just thankful I have the window.",negative
18,2025-11-23 12:40:47,UnitedAirlines,"So you paid a substantial fare premium, are getting up at 5am, and schlepping to EWR, just to have a lie-flat seat on a less than four hour flight? At best, you would only be able to lie flat for about three hours.",negative
19,2025-11-23 12:40:11,UnitedAirlines,Although it is true Lufthansa does not allow carry on plus personal. Clearly stated on their site.,negative
20,2025-11-23 12:39:02,UnitedAirlines,"It did. Latency of 36ms in a plane. That was amazing. Never tried Starlink anywhere, i had minuses what to expect.  And plus, worked from the moment we left the gate, until we reached the destination gate.",positive
21,2025-11-23 12:37:13,AmericanAirlines,"Unfortunately, this seems to be the norm with domestic airlines these days. Customer service is abysmal in these cases, and there’s no customer protections. Sorry your trip ended up being disastrous.",negative
22,2025-11-23 12:36:20,AmericanAirlines,Same. Never gotten an error,negative
23,2025-11-23 12:30:23,AmericanAirlines,"Pro tip: eat before you get on the plane. Makes the flight much more enjoyable, IMO.",positive
24,2025-11-23 12:29:25,AmericanAirlines,Hmmm. I never choose anymore and I never get an error prompt.,negative
25,2025-11-23 12:19:57,AmericanAirlines,"I think Platinum PRO is the sweet spot.   For Platinum, Domestically, as others have says it’s the MCE access, group three boarding, etc. nobody mentioned additional LP on spend.   I’m Platinum Pro. This year, most of my travel has been international  (three extended trips to Australia for family reasons). Access to OWE has made those trips more comfortable Qantas first class lounges are great!) Plus the additional LPs meant I could fly five in first class on most of those trips using points.",positive
26,2025-11-23 12:44:33,SouthwestAirlines,"I’m usually not a “go post on social media” fan, but that seems to be the only way to get Southwest’s attention enough to actually look at things like screenshots. I’ve tried calling and emailing their customer support to no avail.",negative
27,2025-11-23 12:45:01,SouthwestAirlines,Let him laugh. Stare holes into him while simultaneously pushing the button to get the FA. Really pathetic display of spinelessness on your part.,negative
28,2025-11-23 12:44:37,Delta,Thanks. Good information,positive
29,2025-11-23 12:45:28,SouthwestAirlines,Bad seat mates will get that they deserve.,negative
30,2025-11-23 12:45:28,Delta,He was probably my husband.,neutral
31,2025-11-23 12:46:08,UnitedAirlines,Agree 1000%. My hub is EWR. Rarely get upgraded. And there’s so many 1k people that it doesn’t even feel like it means anything anymore. I’m a few segments away from renewing this year and I’m not going out of my way for a run. I need to spend some time at home haha.,negative
32,2025-11-23 12:46:38,SouthwestAirlines,Manspreaders will get that they deserve.,negative
33,2025-11-23 12:46:06,AmericanAirlines,"No it's not optional when booking.    Not sure it's marketing -- I think it's a lingering result of that failed attempt by the now fired guy to set up the system where you wouldn't earn miles unless you booked directly on the AA site or through ""travel partners"". Since most business travelers book through a third party (e.g, via Concur connected to a travel agent), many of those agencies had to get set up as these travel partners and you would have to have the reservation marked as ""business"".  My ""business"" option actually lists the company name that I work for.",negative
34,2025-11-23 12:47:27,UnitedAirlines,10 boxes x 3 types it seems like maybe less...  Pretty sure most of economy is gonna go without regardless.  Used to get annoyed with only 2-3 cheese plates being gone by row 7 and sitting in row 8-10.  Sometimes reversed since the food cart is behind the drink cart and they start before 7-10 and then those rows behind get first dibs 🤣,negative
35,2025-11-23 12:47:44,SouthwestAirlines,Absolutely I wouldn’t even ask politely. This ah thinks he can just take someone else’s space? They’ve then lost the privilege of getting a polite interaction from me.,negative
36,2025-11-23 12:47:55,Delta,I aspire to have this level of raw doggery,neutral
